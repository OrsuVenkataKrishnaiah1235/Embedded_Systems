## Project 5: Design a washing machine controller.

1. Check for the drain switch is closed or not. If it is open, wait until all water drains out and then check the empty water tank switch.
2. If water tank is empty then is turn on relay to close the drain  valve.
After the drain is closed 
3. Ask user to set the washing timer value. 
4. Run the washing motor till the timer time elapse.  
5. After completing the washing drain opens and after a few mins drain closes and it beeps indicating that the washing is completed.
6. During water draining buzzer beeps until the drain valve is again closed. 
7. Use a 20x4 LCD-based menu to show the machine status, timers setting, etc. 
 Use the  Atmega328 IC instead Arduino board.with arduino code
